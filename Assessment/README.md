## Scope, hoisting and compartmentalization

### Answer the following:
In you own words, explain the concepts of scope, hoisting, compartmentalization.


### Provide examples for all three, below:

#### Scope:
The area of effect in which variables can operate.  Variables within elements can reach outside of their elements to be defined, but variables within elements cannot be pulled from.
#### Hoisting:
A process by which JavaScript re-organizes the code to make it easier for the computer to process.  It brings all variable and function declarations to the top of the code and runs it from top to bottom.
#### Compartmentalization:
Variables with the same name can be used within the same code (although it is bad practice) if they are defined in separate
functions within the file.
